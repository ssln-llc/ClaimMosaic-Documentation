# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### How do I set up my profile after creating my account?

Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner of the Claim Mosaic interface to configure your personal information, notification preferences, timezone, and working hours. This ensures you receive the right notifications and your team can reach you when needed.

### I'm the account owner - how do I add my team members?

1. First, check your available licenses in [Settings → Billing & Payment](/settings/billing/)
2. If you need more licenses, purchase additional user licenses through the billing system
3. Navigate to [Settings → User Management](/settings/users/) to invite team members and assign access roles

### What's the difference between Owner and Admin access?

**Owners** can manage billing, user licenses, and all system settings. **Admins** can manage users and most settings but cannot modify billing information. Regular users have access to claims, leads, and tasks based on their assigned permissions.

### How many user licenses do I get with my plan?

License limits vary by plan tier. Check your current license count and available slots in [Settings → Billing & Payment](/settings/billing/). You can upgrade your plan or purchase additional licenses if needed.

## Account Setup

### How do I configure notifications for my team?

Each user can set their own notification preferences by clicking their profile icon. You can also configure system-wide notification settings in [Settings → General](/settings/general/) if you're an admin or owner.

### What should I set up first after creating my account?

1. Configure your personal profile and notification preferences
2. Add your team members (if you're an admin/owner)
3. Set up your company information in General Settings
4. Configure document templates and automation rules
5. Customize fields to match your firm's needs

### Can I import existing data from another system?

Yes, Claim Mosaic supports data import for contacts, companies, and claims. Contact support for assistance with large data imports or specialized formats.

## User Management

### How do I assign different access levels to my team?

Navigate to [Settings → Access Rights](/settings/access-rights/) to view all users and change their access roles. You can assign Owner, Admin, Editor, or Viewer roles based on what each team member needs to access.

### What happens if I disable a user instead of deleting them?

Disabled users cannot log in, but their license becomes available for new users. Their historical activity and data remain intact for auditing and reporting purposes. This is the recommended approach for preserving data integrity.

### Can I see who has access to what in my workspace?

Yes, go to [Settings → Access Rights & Permissions](/settings/access-rights/) to view detailed permission settings for each user role and customize access levels as needed.

## Billing & Licenses

### How do I upgrade my plan to get more features?

Go to [Settings → Billing & Payment](/settings/billing/) to view available plan tiers and upgrade options. You can upgrade at any time to access more advanced features.

### What happens if I exceed my eSignature limit?

Your plan includes a certain number of eSignatures per billing cycle. If you exceed this limit, you can purchase additional eSignatures through the billing system to continue using the feature without interruption.

### Can I downgrade my plan?

To downgrade your plan, you must contact support. This ensures you're aware of any features or data that may become unavailable on a lower tier.

## Getting Help
