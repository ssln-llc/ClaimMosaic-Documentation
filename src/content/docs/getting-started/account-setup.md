# Account Setup

Once you've created your Claim Mosaic account, follow these essential steps to get your workspace ready:

## 1. Configure Your Personal Profile

Click on your **profile icon** in the top-right corner of the Claim Mosaic interface to:

- Set your personal information (name, phone, email)
- Configure your notification preferences
- Choose how you want to receive updates about claims, tasks, and activities
- Set your timezone and working hours

This ensures you receive the right notifications at the right time and that your team can reach you when needed.

## 2. Add Team Members (Admin/Owner Users)

If you're the initial admin or owner of your workspace, you'll need to add your team members:

1. **Check Available Licenses**: Go to [Settings → Billing & Payment](/settings/billing/) to see how many user licenses you have available
2. **Add Licenses if Needed**: If you don't have enough licenses, you can [purchase additional user licenses](/settings/billing/) through the billing system
3. **Add Users**: Navigate to [Settings → User Management](/settings/users/) to invite team members and assign appropriate access roles

**Important**: Only users with **Owner** access can manage billing and user licenses. Regular admins can manage users but cannot modify billing settings.

## 3. Set Up Your Workspace

- Configure your company information in [General Settings](/settings/general/)
- Set up document templates for consistent claim documentation
- Configure automation rules to streamline your workflows
- Customize fields to match your firm's specific needs
