The **Companies** section serves as your centralized address book or directory for all the organizations you interact with during the claims process. This includes insurance carriers, mortgage companies, engineering firms, and any other third-party entity.

By maintaining a central repository for company information, you can:
-   Standardize contact information across all claims.
-   Quickly access details for any company you work with.
-   View all associated contacts and claims linked to a specific company.

This feature is designed to be very similar to the Contacts system but is tailored specifically for managing organizational entities rather than individuals.
