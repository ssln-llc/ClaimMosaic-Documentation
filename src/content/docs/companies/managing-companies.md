The Companies list view provides a straightforward directory of all organizations in your system. Like other list views, it includes search and filtering capabilities to help you quickly locate company records.

### Company Detail Page

Clicking on a company from the list opens its detail page, which is organized into several tabs:

#### 1. Overview Tab

The **Overview** tab contains the primary information for the company:
-   **Company Name:** The official name of the organization.
-   **Email & Phone Number:** Primary contact details for the company.
-   **Address:** The main corporate or mailing address.
-   **Details:** A field for any additional notes or information.

#### 2. Contacts Tab

This tab displays a list of all individual contacts associated with this company. For example, for an insurance company, this list might include all the adjusters, agents, and supervisors you have worked with from that carrier. This provides a quick way to see all your points of contact for a specific organization.

#### 3. Claims Tab

The **Claims** tab shows a filtered list of all claims in your system where this company is involved. This is a powerful feature for quickly reviewing your entire case history with a specific insurance carrier or mortgage company.

#### 4. Files and Notes Tabs

These tabs function as dedicated repositories for documents and notes that are specific to the company record itself, rather than an individual claim. This is useful for storing master service agreements, company-wide contact lists, or general notes about your relationship with the organization.
