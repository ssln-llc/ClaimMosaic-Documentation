The Claim Board provides a visual, Kanban-style interface for managing your claims. It allows you to see the status of all claims at a glance and easily move them through your workflow.

## Navigating the Claim Board

The board is organized into columns, with each column representing a different claim status (e.g., "Originated - New Claim," "Inspection," "Estimating"). Each claim is represented by a card within its respective status column.

### Updating Claim Status

You can instantly update a claim's status by dragging and dropping its card from one column to another.

1.  Click and hold the claim card you want to move.
2.  Drag it to the desired status column.
3.  Release the mouse button to drop the card. The claim's status is updated and saved automatically.

### Viewing and Adding Claims

- **View Details:** Click on any claim card to navigate to its detailed overview page.
- **Add a Claim:** You can add a new claim directly to a specific status column by clicking the **`+ Add another Claim`** button within that column.

## Customizing Your View

You can customize the board to fit your needs.

### Reordering Status Columns

Organize your workflow by dragging and dropping the status column headers into your preferred order. The system will save your custom layout.

### Toggling Empty Statuses

By default, the board only shows status columns that currently contain at least one claim.

- **Click the eyeball icon (`üëÅÔ∏è`)** in the top-right corner to reveal all possible status columns, including empty ones.
- This is useful if you need to move a claim to a status that is not currently active. Click the icon again to hide the empty columns.
