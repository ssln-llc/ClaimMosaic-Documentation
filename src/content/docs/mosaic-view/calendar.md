The Calendar view provides a traditional monthly calendar interface to help you manage your tasks and their due dates. It's an intuitive way to visualize your schedule and stay on top of your responsibilities.

### Navigating the Calendar

- Use the **`<`** and **`>`** arrow buttons at the top-right of the calendar to move between months.
- The calendar will highlight the current day.

### Managing Tasks

- **View Task Details:** Click on a task entry in the calendar to open a sidebar on the right. This sidebar displays all the details of the selected task, including its priority, associated claim/lead, and description.
- **Update and Complete Tasks:** From the details sidebar, you can add notes, make changes, or mark the task as complete.
- **Add a New Task:** Click the **`Add Task`** button at the top-right to create a new task directly from the calendar view.
