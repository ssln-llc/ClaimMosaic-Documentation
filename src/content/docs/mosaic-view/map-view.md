The Map View provides a powerful geographical perspective of your claims, plotting each one as a pin on an interactive map. This is especially useful for planning routes, understanding claim clusters, and managing field inspections.

## Interacting with the Map

The Map View is fully interactive, allowing you to zoom, pan, and filter to find the information you need.

### Filtering by Status

On the left side of the screen, a filter panel lists all claim statuses. You can show or hide claims based on their status:

- **Check a box** to display all claims of that status on the map.
- **Uncheck a box** to hide them.

The pins on the map are color-coded to correspond with their status, making it easy to identify different types of claims.

:::tip[Planning Inspections]
Use the status filters to isolate claims that are in the "Inspection" status. This can help you efficiently plan an inspection route for a specific day or area.

### Viewing Claim Details

- **Click on a map pin** to open a small pop-up window displaying key information about the claim, such as the claim number and policyholder name.
- **Click the claim number or name** within the pop-up to navigate directly to the full claim details page.

### Map and Satellite Views

You can switch between two map styles using the buttons at the top of the map:
- **Map:** A standard, road-map style view.
- **Satellite:** A satellite imagery view.
