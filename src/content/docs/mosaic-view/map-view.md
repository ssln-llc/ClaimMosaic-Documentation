The Map View provides a powerful geographical perspective of your claims, plotting each one as a pin on an interactive map. This is especially useful for planning routes, understanding claim clusters, and managing field inspections.

The Map View is fully interactive, allowing you to zoom, pan, and filter to find the information you need.

### Filtering by Status

On the left side of the screen, a filter panel lists all claim statuses. You can show or hide claims based on their status:

- **Check a box** to display all claims of that status on the map.
- **Uncheck a box** to hide them.

The pins on the map are color-coded to correspond with their status, making it easy to identify different types of claims.

:::tip[Planning Inspections]
Use the status filters to isolate claims that are in the "Inspection" status. This can help you efficiently plan an inspection route for a specific day or area.

### Viewing Claim Details

- **Click on a map pin** to open a small pop-up window displaying key information about the claim, such as the claim number and policyholder name.
- **Click the claim number or name** within the pop-up to navigate directly to the full claim details page.

### Map and Satellite Views

You can switch between two map styles using the buttons at the top of the map:
- **Map:** A standard, road-map style view.
- **Satellite:** A satellite imagery view.
