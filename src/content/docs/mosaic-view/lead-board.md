The Lead Board uses a Kanban-style interface, similar to the Claim Board, to help you visually manage your leads. It allows you to track the progress of leads as they move from initial contact to conversion.

## Using the Lead Board

The board is organized into columns representing different lead statuses, such as "New Lead," "Contacted," and "Converted to Claim."

### Updating Lead Status

Easily update a lead's status by dragging and dropping its card between columns.

1.  Click and hold the lead card you wish to update.
2.  Drag it to the new status column.
3.  Release the card to save the change.

### Viewing and Adding Leads

- **View Details:** Click on any lead card to open its full details page.
- **Add a Lead:** You can create a new lead by clicking the **`+ Add another Lead`** button.

:::note
On the Lead Board, new leads can only be added to the "New Lead" column, ensuring a consistent starting point for all incoming leads.

## Customizing Your View

You can toggle the visibility of empty status columns to customize your view.

- **Click the eyeball icon (`üëÅÔ∏è`)** in the top-right corner to show all possible lead statuses, even if no leads are currently in them.
- This allows you to move a lead to a less common status if needed. Click the icon again to hide the empty columns.
