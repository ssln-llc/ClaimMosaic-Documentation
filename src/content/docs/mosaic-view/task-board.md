The Task Board provides a unique view of your tasks, organizing them vertically based on their due dates. This helps you prioritize your work and focus on what needs to be done now, next, and in the future.

## Understanding the Task Board Layout

Unlike the Claim and Lead boards, the Task Board is not organized by status. Instead, it groups tasks into time-based columns, such as:

- **30+ days overdue**
- **7-14 days overdue**
- **0-7 days overdue**
- **Due in next 7 days**
- **Due in next 7-30 days**

:::caution[View-Only Organization]
Because tasks are automatically grouped by their due date, you cannot drag and drop them between columns on this board. The board is a reflection of the due dates set on the tasks themselves.

## Managing Tasks

- **View Details:** Click on any task card to see its full details and make updates.
- **Complete a Task:** Quickly mark a task as complete by clicking the checkmark icon (`‚úì`) on the task card.

## Customizing Your View

By default, the Task Board only displays columns that contain tasks.

- **Click the eyeball icon (`üëÅÔ∏è`)** in the top-right corner to display all possible time-based columns, even those that are empty. This gives you a complete overview of all time brackets.
- Click the icon again to return to the default view.
