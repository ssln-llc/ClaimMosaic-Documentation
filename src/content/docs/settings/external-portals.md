:::note[Feature Availability]
The External Portal is available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** tiers.
:::

The **External Portal** is a secure, view-only portal that allows you to share claim progress and key details with external stakeholders, such as the policyholder or an attorney, without giving them full access to the system.

### Manage Portal View

This admin page gives you complete control over what information is visible in the portal. Using a simple drag-and-drop interface, you can:

- **Select Visible Fields:** Choose exactly which fields from the claim record are displayed to external users.
- **Reorder Fields:** Arrange the fields in a logical order to create a clean and easy-to-understand view for your clients.

### Allow Document Uploads

You can empower your clients and other stakeholders to contribute directly to the claim file by enabling document uploads.

- **Allow Documents Uploads?:** When this checkbox is enabled, users accessing the portal will see an option to upload files. Any files they upload will be automatically added to the **Files** tab of the corresponding claim record.

This feature is an excellent way to securely and efficiently receive necessary documents from your clients.
