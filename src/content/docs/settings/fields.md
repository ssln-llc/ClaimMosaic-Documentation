:::note[Feature Availability]
Field customization is available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** tiers. The Simple tier uses default fields only.
:::

The **Fields** section provides a powerful drag-and-drop interface to customize the data fields for various record types, including **Claims**, **Leads**, **Contacts**, and **Companies**. This allows you to tailor the application to your specific workflow and data requirements.

### How it Works

1.  **Select a Record Type:** Use the **Filter** dropdowns at the top to choose which record and section you want to customize (e.g., `Claim` > `Overview` > `Loss Details`).
2.  **Add New Fields:** Drag a field type from the left-hand menu (e.g., Text, Dropdown, Date) and drop it into the list on the right.
3.  **Configure the Field:** A modal will appear where you can set the **Label** and other options, such as:
    - **Required:** Make the field mandatory.
    - **Hidden:** Hide the field from view.
    - **Available in External Portal:** (For claim fields) Choose whether this field is visible to clients in the External Portal.
4.  **Reorder Fields:** Drag and drop existing fields to change the order in which they appear on the record page.

### Field Types

You can add the following types of custom fields:
- **Text:** A single line of text.
- **Multi-line text:** A larger text area for detailed descriptions.
- **Checkbox:** A simple true/false checkbox.
- **Dropdown:** A dropdown menu with customizable options.
- **Date:** A date picker.
- **Number:** A field for numerical input.

### Managing Dropdown Options

For dropdown fields (like `Claim Status` or custom dropdowns), you can click on the field to open the **Select Option Manager**. Here, you can add, edit, or delete the available options in the list.
