The **Invoicing** section allows you to configure the default settings for all invoices generated from the **Accounting** tab within a claim. This helps ensure that your invoices are consistent, professional, and contain all the necessary information.

### Defaults

You can customize the following default fields:

- **Company Fee Label:** Change the default label for the main line item on the invoice. By default, it is "Company Fee," but you can change it to something else, like "Service Fee" or "Public Adjusting Fee."
- **Due Date Terms:** Set the default payment terms related to the due date (e.g., "Due upon receipt").
- **Payment Terms:** Add a default block of text that will appear in the "Notes / Terms" section of every invoice. This is the perfect place to include payment instructions, late fee policies, or other standard contractual language.

These defaults can be overridden on a per-invoice basis, but setting them here saves time and ensures a consistent format for all client billing.
