The **User Management** page is where administrators can view, manage, and configure all user accounts within the system.

### User List

The main view displays a list of all users in your organization. From here, you can see at a glance:
- User's name and email.
- The number of assigned Claims, Leads, and Tasks.
- Their current **Access Role**.

### Managing Users

- **Search Users:** Quickly find a specific user by typing their name or email in the search bar.
- **Change Access Role:** Click the dropdown next to a user's name to change their access role (e.g., from Editor to Admin).
- **Disable User:** Instead of deleting users, which could orphan historical data, you can **disable** them. A disabled user can no longer log in, and their license becomes available for a new user. This preserves their activity history for auditing and reporting purposes.
- **Edit User Details:** Click on a user's name to navigate to their contact record, where you can update their name, phone number, and other personal details.

:::tip[Adding New Users]
To add a new user, you must first ensure you have an available license in the [**Billing**](./../billing) section. Once a license is available, you can create a new contact record for the user and then enable them as a system user.
