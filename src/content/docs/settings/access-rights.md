The **Access Rights** page allows you to manage permissions by defining roles that can be assigned to users. This gives you granular control over what each team member can see and do within the system.

### Default Roles

The system comes with four default access roles:

- **Owner:** Has access to everything, including the **Billing** section. This is the only role that can add new users or change the subscription.
- **Admin:** Has access to everything *except* billing details. Can manage all settings and view all records.
- **Editor:** Cannot access admin settings. Can only access records (claims, leads, etc.) that they have created or have been assigned to.
- **Viewer:** Cannot edit anything in the system. Can only view records they have been associated with.

### Custom Roles

:::note[Feature Availability]
Creating custom roles is available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** tiers.
:::

If the default roles don't fit your needs, you can create custom roles with specific permissions.

1.  Click the **Add** button.
2.  Give the new role a **Name** and **Description**.
3.  On the **Manage Access Rights** page, you will see a comprehensive list of all possible permissions in the system, grouped by feature area (e.g., Dashboard, Claim, Lead).
4.  Use the checkboxes to grant the exact permissions you want this role to have.

This flexibility allows you to create roles tailored to specific job functions, such as a "Field Adjuster" who can only view assigned claims and create activities, or a "Finance Manager" who can only access the accounting sections.
