:::note[Feature Availability]
Document Templates are available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** tiers.
:::

The **Document Templates** section allows you to create and manage reusable templates for documents you frequently generate, such as a Letter of Representation (LOR). By using tokens, you can automatically populate documents with specific claim data, saving time and reducing errors.

### Creating a Template

1.  **Create a `.docx` file:** First, create your template in a word processor like Microsoft Word and save it as a `.docx` file.
2.  **Insert Tokens:** In your document, use tokens as placeholders for claim data. A full list of available tokens can be viewed by clicking the **View Available Fields** button.
    - Example: `Insured(s): [PolicyHolder.FullName]`
3.  **Upload the Template:**
    - Click **Create Template**.
    - Give the template a name.
    - Upload your `.docx` file.

### Managing and Previewing Templates

Once uploaded, your templates are listed in the dropdown menu. You can:
- **Preview:** Select a template and then search for a specific claim to see a live preview of how the document will look with that claim's data merged in.
- **Edit:** Click the pencil icon to rename the template.
- **Delete:** Click the trash can icon to remove the template.

This feature streamlines the creation of consistent, professional, and accurate documentation for every claim.
