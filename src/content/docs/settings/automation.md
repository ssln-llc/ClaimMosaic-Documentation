The **Automation** section helps you save time by automating repetitive tasks and setting intelligent defaults for new claims.

### Create System Automations

Automations allow you to automatically trigger a set of actions when a claim is created based on its "Reason" (e.g., New Claim, Supplemental, Re-Open).

To create an automation:
1.  Click **Add Automation**.
2.  Select a **Reason** from the dropdown. This is the trigger for the automation.
3.  **Add Staff:** Automatically assign specific staff members to any claim created with this reason.
4.  **Add Tasks:** Automatically create and assign one or more tasks. You can set the task title, priority, assignee, and the number of days after claim creation it is due.

This ensures that for every new claim, the right team members are assigned and the initial set of tasks is created without any manual intervention.

### Defaults

Set system-wide defaults to ensure consistency and speed up data entry.

- **Company Fee:** Set a default company fee percentage or flat rate that will be automatically applied to all new claims. This can be overridden on a per-claim basis if needed.
- **Email:** This email address will be automatically CC'd on any email sent from a claim record via a user's native email client. This is useful for ensuring a central inbox has a copy of all communications.
- **Default Claim Folders:** Define a standard folder structure that will be automatically created in the **Files** tab for every new claim. This helps keep your documents organized from the very beginning.
