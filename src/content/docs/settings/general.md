The Company Files feature is exclusively available on the **Enterprise** tier as it integrates with the Mosaic AI Assistant.

This section allows you to upload company-wide documents that the AI Assistant can reference. This is a powerful tool for training the AI on your specific business processes and knowledge base.

You can upload documents such as:

By checking **Include in Assistant**, you make the content of these files available to the AI chatbot, allowing it to provide more accurate and context-aware answers to user queries.
