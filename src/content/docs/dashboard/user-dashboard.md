The User Dashboard is the first page you see upon logging in. It's designed to give you a high-level overview of your most important tasks, claims, and leads at a glance. The dashboard is personalized to show data relevant to you based on your user permissions.

## Key Metric Charts

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find four key metric charts that summarize your current workload. Each of these charts is interactive; you can click on any of them to navigate directly to a detailed list of the corresponding items.

- **Assigned Tasks:** Shows the total count of tasks currently assigned to you.
- **Overdue Tasks:** Highlights the number of your assigned tasks that have passed their due date.
- **Claims Assigned:** Displays the total number of claims assigned to you.
- **Leads Assigned:** Shows the total count of leads assigned to you.

:::note[Permissions]
The data displayed in your dashboard charts is specific to your user account. Standard users will see counts related only to their own assigned items. Users with Admin or Owner roles will see system-wide totals.

## Data Visualization Charts

Below the key metrics, two interactive radar charts provide a visual breakdown of your claims and leads by their current status.

### Claim Chart

The Claim Chart visualizes the distribution of your claims across different stages of the workflow, such as:
- Originated - New Claim
- Estimating
- Inspection
- Mediation
- Duplicate

### Lead Chart

Similarly, the Lead Chart shows the status of your leads, categorized into stages like:
- New Lead
- Contacted
- Converted to Claim

### Interacting with Charts

You can customize the chart view and drill down into the data:

- **Filter Data:** Click on any item in the chart's legend to toggle its visibility. This allows you to focus on the specific statuses that are most important to you.
- **Drill Down:** Click on a specific colored segment within the chart itself to navigate to a pre-filtered list showing all items in that status. For example, clicking the "Estimating" segment will take you to a list of all claims currently in the estimating phase.

## Main Navigation

The main navigation sidebar on the left provides access to all modules in the application. You can collapse or expand it at any time to maximize your screen real estate.

- **Click the hamburger menu icon (`☰`)** at the top of the sidebar to collapse it.
- **Click the icon again** to expand it.
