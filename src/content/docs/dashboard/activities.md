The **Activities** feed, located at the bottom of the User Dashboard, provides a chronological log of recent actions taken on records you have access to. It helps you stay informed about updates, communications, and task completions without needing to check each record individually.

:::note
While the demo video shows an empty feed, in a live environment this section will populate with activities as they occur.

## Viewing and Filtering Activities

The feed is designed to be easy to scan and filter, so you can quickly find the information you need.

### Time-Based Filters

You can filter the activities shown based on a specific time period. The available options are:

- **Today:** Shows all activities that occurred today.
- **Yesterday:** Shows all activities from the previous day.
- **Last 7 Days:** Displays a summary of all activities over the past week.

### Activity Type Filters

In addition to filtering by time, you can also filter by the type of activity. This is useful for focusing on specific kinds of interactions, such as communications or tasks.

The available type filters include:
- **All** (Default)
- **Note**
- **Email**
- **Phone Call**
- **Confidential**
- **Task**

### Personalized View

The Activities feed is personalized for each user.
- **Standard Users** will see activities related only to records they are assigned to or have permission to view.
- **Admins and Owners** will see a system-wide feed of all activities, reflecting their broader access rights.
