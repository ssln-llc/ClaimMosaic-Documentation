The dashboard widgets are designed to give you a quick, visual summary of your key metrics and data distributions. They are interactive, allowing you to navigate directly to the underlying data.

## Key Metric Widgets

Located at the top of the User Dashboard, these four widgets provide a numerical summary of your most immediate responsibilities.

- **Assigned Tasks:** The total number of tasks assigned to you.
- **Overdue Tasks:** A count of your tasks that are past their due date, requiring immediate attention.
- **Claims Assigned:** The total number of claims you are responsible for.
- **Leads Assigned:** The total number of leads assigned to you.

Click on the number in any widget to jump directly to a detailed list view of those specific items. For example, clicking on "7 Overdue Tasks" will take you to a list of those seven tasks.

## Data Visualization Charts

The **Claim Chart** and **Lead Chart** use a radar chart format to provide a clear visual breakdown of your records by their current status.

### Interacting with the Charts

These charts are more than just static images; they are interactive tools for data exploration.

#### Filtering by Status

You can filter the data shown on a chart by clicking on the labels in its legend. This action toggles the visibility of that status on the chart, allowing you to hide categories you don't need to see and focus on the ones that matter most.

#### Drilling Down into Data

To see the specific records that make up a segment of the chart, simply click on that colored segment. This will take you to a pre-filtered list page showing all the claims or leads in that particular status.

### Chart Statuses

The charts categorize your records by the following statuses:

| Chart       | Statuses                                                                 |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Claim Chart** | `Originated - New Claim`, `Estimating`, `Inspection`, `Mediation`, `Duplicate` |
| **Lead Chart**  | `New Lead`, `Contacted`, `Converted to Claim`                            |
