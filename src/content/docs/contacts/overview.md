The **Contacts** section is a unified Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that serves as a central directory for every individual you interact with. Unlike other systems that might have separate lists for clients and staff, this section consolidates everyone into a single, manageable database.

### A Single Source of Truth

Every person, regardless of their role, is stored here. This includes:
-   **Policyholders** (Clients)
-   **Users** (Your internal staff)
-   **Adjusters**
-   **Attorneys**
-   **Engineers**
-   Any other individual involved in a claim or lead

This unified approach prevents duplicate entries and ensures that you have a single, authoritative record for each person. A contact can be associated with multiple claims, leads, or companies, and all of these relationships are tracked within their individual contact record.

From this section, you can add new contacts, search and filter your entire directory, and access detailed records for each individual.
