The Contacts section provides a simple yet powerful interface for managing your entire network of individuals.

### The Contacts List

The main page of the Contacts section displays an alphabetized list of all contacts in your system. From here, you can quickly see their primary phone number and email address.

Like other list views in the application, you can use the **Search** bar to find contacts in real-time or use the **Filters** panel to narrow down the list by specific criteria, such as:
-   **State** or **City**
-   **Contact Type** (e.g., show only "Attorneys" or "Policyholders")
-   **Licensed User**

### The Contact Detail Page

Clicking on any contact in the list opens their **Contact Detail Page**. This page is organized into tabs to provide a complete 360-degree view of the individual.

#### Overview Tab
This tab contains the contact's core personal information:
-   First and Last Name
-   Email and Phone Number (with options for secondary contacts)
-   Address
-   Date of Birth (DOB)

#### Contact Types
At the top of the detail page, you can assign one or more **Contact Types** to a person. This is how you "tag" or categorize them within the system. For example, a single contact can be tagged as both a `Policyholder` and a `Lead`, or as an `Adjuster` and an `Appraiser`. This flexible tagging is used for filtering and reporting.

#### Claims Tab
The **Claims** tab shows a complete list of every claim that this individual is associated with. This provides an instant history of your interactions and cases with that person, allowing you to quickly reference past files.

#### Files Tab
This tab is a repository for documents that are specific to the contact themselves, rather than a particular claim. It's the perfect place to store:
-   W-9 forms
-   Professional licenses
-   Personnel records for staff members
-   Signed service agreements

#### Notes Tab
The **Notes** tab is for adding general notes about the contact that are not tied to a specific claim. This is useful for recording relationship details, communication preferences, or any other relevant information you want to keep on file for that person.
