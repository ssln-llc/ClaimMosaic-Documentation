The main **Tasks** section, accessible from the primary navigation menu, is a global dashboard that consolidates all tasks from every claim and lead across the entire system. While individual tasks can be managed within each claim or lead, this page provides a high-level, centralized view of all pending and completed work.

This global view is essential for:
-   **Personal Productivity:** See all tasks assigned to you in one place, regardless of which claim or lead they belong to.
-   **Team Management:** Admins and owners can get a complete picture of the workload across all staff members.
-   **Prioritization:** Quickly identify overdue or high-priority tasks that require immediate attention.

The list is fully searchable and filterable, allowing you to easily drill down and focus on the items that matter most.
