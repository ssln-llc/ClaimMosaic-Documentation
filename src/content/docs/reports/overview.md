The **Reports** section is a powerful tool that allows you to generate detailed, list-style reports based on the data you've stored in the Claims, Leads, Contacts, and Companies sections. This feature is built upon the filtering system, enabling you to create highly specific and customized data exports.

### How It Works

The reporting tool is directly tied to the **Saved Filters** you create in other sections of the application. To generate a report, you first create and save a filter that isolates the exact data set you need.

For example, you could create a saved filter in the Claims section for "All Hurricane Claims Closed This Year." This saved filter will then appear in the Reports section as a template for a new report.

### Key Features

-   **Custom Report Generation:** Build reports for Claims, Leads, Contacts, or Companies.
-   **Filter-Based Logic:** Use your saved filters as the foundation for any report.
-   **Customizable Fields:** Select exactly which data fields (columns) you want to include in your final report.
-   **Exportable Data:** Export your generated reports to a clean, professional PDF format.
