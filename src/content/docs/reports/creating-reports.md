Creating a report is a straightforward process that gives you full control over the data you want to present.

### Step 1: Create a Report

1.  Navigate to the **Reports** section.
2.  Click the **+** button at the top right.
3.  Select the type of report you want to create:
    -   Create Claim Report
    -   Create Lead Report
    -   Create Contact Report
    -   Create Company Report

### Step 2: Configure the Report

You will be taken to the **Report Builder** page, where you can configure the report's content and layout.

1.  **Title:** Give your report a descriptive title.
2.  **Filter:** This is the most important step. Select one of your **Saved Filters** from the dropdown menu. The data in your report will be based entirely on the criteria of this filter.
3.  **Permissions:** (Optional) Set which users or user roles can view and run this report.
4.  **Sort:** Choose a primary field to sort the report data by (e.g., sort claims by `Claim Number`).
5.  **Fields:** Select the checkboxes for each data field you want to include as a column in your report. You can choose from any standard or custom field associated with the record type.

### Step 3: Generate and Export

Once you have configured the report, a live preview will be generated in the main window.

-   **Review:** Check the preview to ensure the report contains the correct data and columns.
-   **Export:** Click the **Export** button to download the report as a PDF file.
-   **Save:** Click **Save** to save this report configuration. It will now appear in your main Reports list, ready to be run again at any time.

:::tip[Excluding Confidential Information]
When selecting your report fields, you can choose to include or exclude confidential activities and tasks. This allows you to create versions of a report suitable for different audiences, such as an internal version with all notes and an external version for an attorney that omits sensitive information.
