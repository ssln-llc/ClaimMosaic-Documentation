When you navigate to the Claims section, you land on the **Claims List View**. This page displays all the claims in the system in a paginated table, providing a high-level overview of key information at a glance.

## Searching and Filtering

To efficiently manage and locate claims, you have two primary tools available on this page: a real-time search and an advanced filtering system.

### Real-Time Search

The search bar located at the top right of the claims table allows for a quick and effective way to find claims. As you type into the search box, the list of claims is refined in real-time to match your query, searching across all relevant fields.

For example, typing `nic` will instantly filter the list to show only claims where "nic" appears, such as in a policyholder's name like "Nicole Samson."

### Advanced Filters

For more specific queries, the **Filters** button opens a comprehensive side panel with numerous criteria to narrow down your claims list.

You can filter by a wide range of fields, including:
- Claim Status
- Insurance Company
- Mortgage Company
- Date of Loss
- Licensed User
- Fee Type
- And many more...

#### Saved Filters

To save time, you can create and save combinations of filters that you use frequently. The system comes with several default saved filters, such as "All Open Claims" and "All Inactive Claims," which you can use, modify, or delete as needed.

To use a saved filter:
1. Click the **Filters** button to open the panel.
2. Expand the **Saved Filters** dropdown.
3. Select the desired filter (e.g., "Ins & Est").
4. Click **Apply Filters**.

The list will update to show only the claims that match the criteria of your saved filter.

The filtering system is directly integrated with the **Reporting** feature. Creating and saving specific filters is essential for generating targeted reports, such as monthly performance reviews or workload distributions.

## Quick Actions

The list view also provides several shortcuts to perform common actions without needing to open the full claim detail page.

- **Quick Add Menu** (`...`): Click the three-dot icon on the left of a claim row to open the Quick Add menu. From here, you can instantly:
    - **Add Activity:** Log a new note, email, or phone call.
    - **Add Task:** Create and assign a new task for the claim.
    - **Copy Email:** Copy the unique claim email address to your clipboard.

- **Change Status**: Click the pencil icon next to the `Claim Status` to quickly update the status of a claim.

- **Inactivity Flag**: The system automatically flags claims with no recent activity. A red flag indicates that a claim has been inactive for 30 or more days, helping you identify stalled files.
