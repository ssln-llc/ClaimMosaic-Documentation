The **Accounting** tab is your financial command center for each claim. It provides a detailed breakdown of all monetary transactions, from initial settlements to final commissions, ensuring accurate financial tracking.

The tab is divided into several sub-sections, accessible from the left-hand menu.

### Summary

This is the main dashboard view for the claim's finances. It provides a high-level overview with key metrics:
- **Total Payments:** The sum of all payments received from the carrier.
- **Funds to Client:** The portion of the total payments due to the client after deducting fees and billable expenses.
- **Company Fee:**
    - **Gross Company Fee:** The total fee calculated based on the fee structure (e.g., 20% of total payments).
    - **Net Company Fee:** The Gross Company Fee minus any company-paid expenses and commissions.
- **Time Logged:** A summary of total time and billable time logged in the **Activity** tab.

### Generate Invoice

From the Summary view, you can generate a professional invoice for your client.
1.  Click the **Generate Invoice** button.
2.  In the "New Invoice" modal, enter the **Invoice Number**, **Invoice Date**, **Due Date**, and any specific **Terms**.
3.  Click **Generate**.

The system will produce a clean, downloadable PDF invoice that includes your company logo, the client's details, and a line item for the company fee.

### Settlements

This section allows you to track settlement offers and proposals.
- **Add Settlement:** Record a new settlement offer, including the date, coverage type, and amount.
- **Outstanding vs. Recovered:** New settlements appear as "Outstanding." Once you receive the funds, you can **Convert** the settlement into a payment, moving it to the "Recovered" category.

### Payments

Here, you can manage all payments received from the carrier.
- **Add Payment:** Manually add a payment or convert it from a settlement.
- **Details:** You can record the check/reference number, date, and amount. You can also upload images of the front and back of the check for complete documentation.

### Expenses

Track all costs associated with managing the claim.
- **Add Expense:** Enter the date, amount, payee, and a description.
- **Responsible Party:** Designate whether the expense was paid by the **Client** or the **Company**.
- **Billable:** If an expense is marked as "Billable," it will be deducted from the "Funds to Client" total. Non-billable company expenses are deducted from the "Net Company Fee."

### Commissions

The **Commissions** section helps you calculate and track payouts to your staff.
1.  Click **Add Commission Worksheet**.
2.  **Select Payments & Expenses:** Choose which outstanding payments and expenses to include in the calculation. This allows you to run commissions on partial payments.
3.  **Assign Commissions:** For each staff member on the claim, you can assign a commission based on:
    - **Percentage:** A percentage of the Net Company Fee for the selected transactions.
    - **Flat Fee:** A fixed dollar amount.
    - **Time:** A rate multiplied by the billable hours logged by that staff member.

The system automatically calculates the total commission for each staff member based on your inputs.
