The **Activity** tab provides a comprehensive, time-stamped diary of every action and communication related to the claim. This serves as the official record, ensuring a clear and auditable history from start to finish.

### The Activity Feed

The main part of the tab is the activity feed, which displays all entries in reverse chronological order. Each entry shows who performed the action and when it occurred.

### Adding New Activities

You can add several types of activities using the input box at the top of the feed:

- **Note:** A general-purpose entry for internal comments, file updates, or any relevant information.
- **Email:** Log communications sent or received via email.
- **Phone Call:** Document conversations with clients, adjusters, or other parties.

For any activity, you can also:
- **Attach a file:** Link a document or image directly to the note.
- **Log Time:** Enter the hours and minutes spent on the activity. You can mark this time as **Billable** to have it included in financial calculations on the Accounting tab.
- **Mark as Confidential:** Check the "eye" icon to mark a note as confidential. Confidential notes can be excluded from generated reports for privacy.

### Filtering the Feed

To quickly find specific information, you can use the filter buttons at the top of the feed to show only:
- All
- Note
- Email
- Phone Call
- Confidential
- Task

### Managing Activities

- **Pin Activity:** Click the thumbtack icon on an important entry to pin it to the top of the activity feed for easy reference.
- **Delete Activity:** Users with appropriate permissions (typically Admins and Owners) can delete an activity by clicking the trash can icon.
