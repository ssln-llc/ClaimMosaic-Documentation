The **Files** tab is the central repository for all documents, images, and other files associated with a claim. It provides a robust system for file management, document generation, and secure sharing.

### File and Folder Management

- **Upload Files:** You can upload one or more files by dragging and dropping them onto the page or by using the **Upload a file(s)** button.
- **Create Folders:** Keep your documents organized by creating folders. Click the **New Folder** button to add a new folder to the claim.
- **Preview and Download:** Click on a file to see a preview (for supported file types like PDFs and images) or to view its details. From the preview or details pane, you can download the file to your local machine.

### Document Generation

The **Generate a Document** feature allows you to create new documents from pre-configured templates. This is perfect for standard communications like a Letter of Representation (LOR).

1.  Click **Generate a Document**.
2.  Select a template from the dropdown list.
3.  The system will merge the current claim's data (e.g., policyholder name, policy number) into the template and generate a new document.
4.  You can then preview the generated document and download it.

### E-Signatures

After generating a document, you can send it for electronic signature directly from the platform.

1.  Generate a document using a template.
2.  In the document preview window, click the **Request Signature** icon (looks like a fountain pen).
3.  In the **Signees** section, select the contacts who need to sign the document.
4.  Customize the email **Subject** and **Body** if needed.
5.  Click **Send**.

The selected contacts will receive an email with a secure link to review and sign the document electronically. The signed document will be automatically saved back to the claim's files.
