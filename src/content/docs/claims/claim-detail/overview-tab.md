The **Overview** tab is the default landing page when you open a claim's detail view. It contains the most essential information about the claim, divided into logical sections for clarity and quick access.

### Quick View Header

At the top of the page, a header provides at-a-glance information:
- **Claim Number & Status:** The unique claim identifier and its current status (e.g., Originated - New Claim, Inspection).
- **Recovery Stat:** A metric showing the total amount recovered versus the deductible.
- **Policyholder Name:** The primary policyholder for the claim.
- **Date of Loss:** The date the loss occurred.
- **Policy Number:** The associated insurance policy number.

### Loss Details

This section captures the fundamental details about the property damage incident. Key fields include:
- **Loss Address:** The physical address where the loss occurred.
- **Date of Loss:** The date of the incident.
- **Loss Type & Secondary Loss Type:** Categories to classify the nature of the damage.
- **Estimated Claim Value:** Your initial estimate of the claim's total value.
- **Prior Payments:** Any payments made by the carrier before your involvement.
- **Loss Description:** A text field for a detailed narrative of the loss.

### Policy Holder

Here you can manage the primary and any secondary policyholders associated with the claim. This section displays their contact information, which is pulled from the main **Contacts** database.

### Company Details

This section is for internal administrative information:
- **Company Fee:** Set the fee structure for the claim. You can choose between:
    - **Flat Fee:** A fixed dollar amount.
    - **Percent:** A percentage of the total settlement.
    - **Hourly:** Based on time logged in the Activity tab.
- **Contract Date:** The date the service agreement was signed.
- **Reason:** The reason for the claim (e.g., New Claim, Re-Open/Denial).

### Generate Report

At the bottom of the page, the **Generate Report** button opens the **Report Builder**. This powerful tool allows you to create a custom PDF report for the claim. You can select which sections of the claim record to include, such as:
- Loss Details
- Policyholder Information
- Insurance Policy Details
- Accounting Summary
- All Activities and Tasks
- Attached Files

This flexibility enables you to tailor reports for different audiences, like attorneys, clients, or internal reviews.
