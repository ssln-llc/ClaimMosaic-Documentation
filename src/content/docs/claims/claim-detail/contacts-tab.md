The **Contacts** tab serves as a centralized address book for every individual and company involved in a specific claim. This ensures that all stakeholder information is organized and easily accessible.

### Contact Categories

Contacts are organized into logical categories using sub-tabs for quick navigation:
- **All:** Displays every contact linked to the claim.
- **General:** Typically includes the policyholder(s) and other general contacts.
- **Carrier:** For contacts from the insurance company, such as the desk adjuster or field adjuster.
- **Staff:** Lists all internal users (your staff) assigned to or involved with the claim.

### Managing Contacts

- **Adding a Contact:** Click the **Add** button to link a new contact to the claim. You can search for an existing contact from your central database or create a new one on the fly.
- **Assigning Roles:** When adding a contact, you must assign them a **Contact Type** (e.g., Carrier Desk Adjuster, Attorney) and specify which **Section** (General, Carrier, or Staff) they belong to.

### External Portal (EP)

:::note[Feature Availability]
The External Portal is available on the **Professional** and **Enterprise** tiers.
:::

The External Portal (EP) is a secure, view-only portal that allows you to share claim information with external stakeholders like policyholders or attorneys without giving them full access to the system.

- **Granting Access:** Any contact with an "EP" icon next to their name has been granted access. You can send them a unique, secure link to the portal.
- **Authentication:** For security, the contact must enter their email address to authenticate and access the portal.
- **Functionality:** Inside the portal, the contact can:
    - View key claim details that you have configured to be visible.
    - Upload files directly to the claim's **Files** tab.

This feature is ideal for keeping clients informed and for securely receiving documents from third parties.
