Once a prospect has signed a contract and become a client, you can convert their lead record into an active claim. This action seamlessly transfers all existing information—including contact details, notes, tasks, and files—to a new claim record.

To begin, navigate to the lead's detail page and click the **Convert to Claim** button at the bottom right of the screen.

You will be presented with two options for creating the new claim:

### 1. AI Policy Upload

The AI Policy Upload feature is exclusively available on the **Enterprise** tier.

This powerful option uses AI to automate data entry. Simply upload the client's insurance policy document (PDF), and the system will scan it to automatically populate the policy details in the new claim record. This significantly reduces manual work and ensures accuracy.

### 2. Manual Entry

If you don't have the policy document yet or prefer to enter the information yourself, choose **Manual Entry**. This option will open a form where you can input the initial claim details, such as:

-   **Claim Status**
-   **Reason** for the claim
-   **Claim Number**
-   **Company Fee** structure
-   **Contract Date**

The lead's existing contact and address information will be automatically carried over to the new claim. After converting, the lead record will be archived, and you will be redirected to the newly created claim detail page to continue managing the file.
