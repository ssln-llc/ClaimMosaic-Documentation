The **Leads List View** is the main dashboard for the Leads section. It presents all your leads in a table format, allowing you to quickly see their status and key details.

## Searching and Filtering

Similar to the Claims list, the Leads list provides powerful tools to help you locate specific records quickly.

### Real-Time Search

Use the search bar at the top right of the table to instantly filter the list as you type. The search scans across all lead fields, including name, address, phone, and email, to find matching records.

### Advanced Filters

For more granular control, click the **Filters** button to open the filtering panel. You can narrow down your leads based on criteria such as:

-   **Lead Status:** (e.g., New Lead, Contacted, Inspected)
-   **City** or **Postal Code**
-   **Licensed User:** The staff member assigned to the lead.
-   **Inactive Status:** Find leads that haven't had recent activity.

You can also create and use **Saved Filters** to quickly apply frequently used filter combinations.

## Quick Actions

From the list view, you can perform several actions without navigating to the full lead detail page.

-   **Quick Add Menu** (`...`): Click the three-dot icon to the left of any lead to:
    -   **Add Activity:** Log a note, email, or phone call.
    -   **Add Task:** Create a new to-do item for the lead.
-   **Change Lead Status**: Click the pencil icon next to the `Lead Status` to quickly update the lead's progress through your pipeline.

These shortcuts are designed to streamline your workflow and make lead management more efficient.
