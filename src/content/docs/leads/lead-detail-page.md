The **Lead Detail Page** provides a complete view of a single prospect. To access it, simply click on any lead from the main list view. The page is organized into several tabs, making it easy to find and manage all related information.

### Overview Tab

This is the main tab, containing the lead's core information:
-   **Contact Information:** First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number.
-   **Address:** The property address associated with the potential claim.
-   **Details:** A free-text field for any additional notes or context about the lead.
-   **Custom Fields:** Any custom fields you have configured for leads (e.g., "New Field," "Property Type") will also appear here.

### Activity Tab

The Activity tab functions exactly like the one in the Claims section. It provides a chronological feed of all interactions with the lead, including notes, emails, and phone calls. You can add new activities, attach files, and log billable time here.

### Staff Tab

This tab shows which of your internal users are assigned to or involved with the lead. You can add or remove staff members as needed to manage assignments.

### Tasks Tab

Manage all to-do items for the lead in the Tasks tab. You can add new tasks, assign them to staff members, set due dates and priorities, and track their status.

### Files Tab

The Files tab is the document repository for the lead. You can upload any relevant files, such as photos, initial correspondence, or unsigned documents. You can also create folders to keep the files organized.
