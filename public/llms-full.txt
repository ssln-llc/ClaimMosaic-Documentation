Clicking on any contact in the list opens their **Contact Detail Page**. This page is organized into tabs to provide a complete 360-degree view of the individual.

#### Overview Tab

[Section titled “Overview Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/contacts/managing-contacts/#overview-tab)

This tab contains the contact’s core personal information:

- First and Last Name
- Email and Phone Number (with options for secondary contacts)
- Address
- Date of Birth (DOB)

#### Contact Types

[Section titled “Contact Types”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/contacts/managing-contacts/#contact-types)

At the top of the detail page, you can assign one or more **Contact Types** to a person. This is how you “tag” or categorize them within the system. For example, a single contact can be tagged as both a `Policyholder` and a `Lead`, or as an `Adjuster` and an `Appraiser`. This flexible tagging is used for filtering and reporting.

#### Claims Tab

[Section titled “Claims Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/contacts/managing-contacts/#claims-tab)

The **Claims** tab shows a complete list of every claim that this individual is associated with. This provides an instant history of your interactions and cases with that person, allowing you to quickly reference past files.

#### Files Tab

[Section titled “Files Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/contacts/managing-contacts/#files-tab)

This tab is a repository for documents that are specific to the contact themselves, rather than a particular claim. It’s the perfect place to store:

- W-9 forms
- Professional licenses
- Personnel records for staff members
- Signed service agreements

#### Notes Tab

[Section titled “Notes Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/contacts/managing-contacts/#notes-tab)

The **Notes** tab is for adding general notes about the contact that are not tied to a specific claim. This is useful for recording relationship details, communication preferences, or any other relevant information you want to keep on file for that person.

## Contacts Overview
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/contacts/overview/#_top)

# Contacts Overview

The **Contacts** section is a unified Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that serves as a central directory for every individual you interact with. Unlike other systems that might have separate lists for clients and staff, this section consolidates everyone into a single, manageable database.

### A Single Source of Truth

[Section titled “A Single Source of Truth”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/contacts/overview/#a-single-source-of-truth)

Every person, regardless of their role, is stored here. This includes:

- **Policyholders** (Clients)
- **Users** (Your internal staff)
- **Adjusters**
- **Attorneys**
- **Engineers**
- Any other individual involved in a claim or lead

This unified approach prevents duplicate entries and ensures that you have a single, authoritative record for each person. A contact can be associated with multiple claims, leads, or companies, and all of these relationships are tracked within their individual contact record.

From this section, you can add new contacts, search and filter your entire directory, and access detailed records for each individual.

## User Activities Feed
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/dashboard/activities/#_top)

- **Last 7 Days:** Displays a summary of all activities over the past week.

### Activity Type Filters

[Section titled “Activity Type Filters”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/dashboard/activities/#activity-type-filters)

In addition to filtering by time, you can also filter by the type of activity. This is useful for focusing on specific kinds of interactions, such as communications or tasks.

The available type filters include:

- **All** (Default)
- **Note**
- **Email**
- **Phone Call**
- **Confidential**
- **Task**

### Personalized View

[Section titled “Personalized View”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/dashboard/activities/#personalized-view)

The Activities feed is personalized for each user.

## Admin Dashboard Overview
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/dashboard/admin-dashboard/#_top)

To help you find specific information quickly, the User Activities log includes robust filtering options and an export feature.

### Filtering Activities

[Section titled “Filtering Activities”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/dashboard/admin-dashboard/#filtering-activities)

You can apply filters to narrow down the activity log based on:

- **Users:** Select one or more users to see only their activities.
- **Record Type:** Filter the log to show actions on specific record types, like `Claim` or `Lead`.
- **Date Range:** Use the date picker to view activities within a specific time frame.

After setting your criteria, click the **Apply Filters** button to update the list.

### Export to Excel

[Section titled “Export to Excel”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/dashboard/admin-dashboard/#export-to-excel)

## Lead to Claim Process
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/converting-to-claim/#_top)

# Converting a Lead to a Claim

Once a prospect has signed a contract and become a client, you can convert their lead record into an active claim. This action seamlessly transfers all existing information—including contact details, notes, tasks, and files—to a new claim record.

To begin, navigate to the lead’s detail page and click the **Convert to Claim** button at the bottom right of the screen.

You will be presented with two options for creating the new claim:

### 1\. AI Policy Upload

[Section titled “1. AI Policy Upload”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/converting-to-claim/#1-ai-policy-upload)

This powerful option uses AI to automate data entry. Simply upload the client’s insurance policy document (PDF), and the system will scan it to automatically populate the policy details in the new claim record. This significantly reduces manual work and ensures accuracy.

### 2\. Manual Entry

[Section titled “2. Manual Entry”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/converting-to-claim/#2-manual-entry)

If you don’t have the policy document yet or prefer to enter the information yourself, choose **Manual Entry**. This option will open a form where you can input the initial claim details, such as:

- **Claim Status**
- **Reason** for the claim
- **Claim Number**
- **Company Fee** structure
- **Contract Date**

The lead’s existing contact and address information will be automatically carried over to the new claim. After converting, the lead record will be archived, and you will be redirected to the newly created claim detail page to continue managing the file.

## Lead Detail Overview
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/lead-detail-page/#_top)

# Lead Detail Page

The **Lead Detail Page** provides a complete view of a single prospect. To access it, simply click on any lead from the main list view. The page is organized into several tabs, making it easy to find and manage all related information.

### Overview Tab

[Section titled “Overview Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/lead-detail-page/#overview-tab)

This is the main tab, containing the lead’s core information:

- **Contact Information:** First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number.
- **Address:** The property address associated with the potential claim.
- **Details:** A free-text field for any additional notes or context about the lead.
- **Custom Fields:** Any custom fields you have configured for leads (e.g., “New Field,” “Property Type”) will also appear here.

### Activity Tab

[Section titled “Activity Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/lead-detail-page/#activity-tab)

The Activity tab functions exactly like the one in the Claims section. It provides a chronological feed of all interactions with the lead, including notes, emails, and phone calls. You can add new activities, attach files, and log billable time here.

### Staff Tab

[Section titled “Staff Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/lead-detail-page/#staff-tab)

This tab shows which of your internal users are assigned to or involved with the lead. You can add or remove staff members as needed to manage assignments.

### Tasks Tab

[Section titled “Tasks Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/lead-detail-page/#tasks-tab)

Manage all to-do items for the lead in the Tasks tab. You can add new tasks, assign them to staff members, set due dates and priorities, and track their status.

### Files Tab

[Section titled “Files Tab”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/lead-detail-page/#files-tab)

## Searching and Filtering

### Advanced Filters

[Section titled “Advanced Filters”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/managing-leads/#advanced-filters)

- **City** or **Postal Code**

- **Inactive Status:** Find leads that haven’t had recent activity.

You can also create and use **Saved Filters** to quickly apply frequently used filter combinations.

## Quick Actions

[Section titled “Quick Actions”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/leads/managing-leads/#quick-actions)

From the list view, you can perform several actions without navigating to the full lead detail page.

- **Quick Add Menu** (`...`): Click the three-dot icon to the left of any lead to:

  - **Add Task:** Create a new to-do item for the lead.

# Reports

## Report Creation Guide
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/reports/creating-reports/#_top)

# Creating and Customizing Reports

Creating a report is a straightforward process that gives you full control over the data you want to present.

### Step 1: Create a Report

[Section titled “Step 1: Create a Report”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/reports/creating-reports/#step-1-create-a-report)

1. Navigate to the **Reports** section.
2. Click the **+** button at the top right.
3. Select the type of report you want to create:
   - Create Claim Report
   - Create Lead Report
   - Create Contact Report
   - Create Company Report

### Step 2: Configure the Report

[Section titled “Step 2: Configure the Report”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/reports/creating-reports/#step-2-configure-the-report)

You will be taken to the **Report Builder** page, where you can configure the report’s content and layout.

1. **Title:** Give your report a descriptive title.
2. **Filter:** This is the most important step. Select one of your **Saved Filters** from the dropdown menu. The data in your report will be based entirely on the criteria of this filter.
3. **Permissions:** (Optional) Set which users or user roles can view and run this report.
4. **Sort:** Choose a primary field to sort the report data by (e.g., sort claims by `Claim Number`).
5. **Fields:** Select the checkboxes for each data field you want to include as a column in your report. You can choose from any standard or custom field associated with the record type.

### Step 3: Generate and Export

[Section titled “Step 3: Generate and Export”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/reports/creating-reports/#step-3-generate-and-export)

Once you have configured the report, a live preview will be generated in the main window.

- **Review:** Check the preview to ensure the report contains the correct data and columns.
- **Export:** Click the **Export** button to download the report as a PDF file.
- **Save:** Click **Save** to save this report configuration. It will now appear in your main Reports list, ready to be run again at any time.

## Reports Overview
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/reports/overview/#_top)

# Reports Overview

The **Reports** section is a powerful tool that allows you to generate detailed, list-style reports based on the data you’ve stored in the Claims, Leads, Contacts, and Companies sections. This feature is built upon the filtering system, enabling you to create highly specific and customized data exports.

### How It Works

[Section titled “How It Works”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/reports/overview/#how-it-works)

The reporting tool is directly tied to the **Saved Filters** you create in other sections of the application. To generate a report, you first create and save a filter that isolates the exact data set you need.

For example, you could create a saved filter in the Claims section for “All Hurricane Claims Closed This Year.” This saved filter will then appear in the Reports section as a template for a new report.

### Key Features

[Section titled “Key Features”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/reports/overview/#key-features)

- **Custom Report Generation:** Build reports for Claims, Leads, Contacts, or Companies.
- **Filter-Based Logic:** Use your saved filters as the foundation for any report.
- **Customizable Fields:** Select exactly which data fields (columns) you want to include in your final report.
- **Exportable Data:** Export your generated reports to a clean, professional PDF format.

## User Access Management
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/access-rights/#_top)

# Access Rights & Permissions

The **Access Rights** page allows you to manage permissions by defining roles that can be assigned to users. This gives you granular control over what each team member can see and do within the system.

### Default Roles

[Section titled “Default Roles”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/access-rights/#default-roles)

The system comes with four default access roles:

- **Owner:** Has access to everything, including the **Billing** section. This is the only role that can add new users or change the subscription.
- **Admin:** Has access to everything _except_ billing details. Can manage all settings and view all records.
- **Editor:** Cannot access admin settings. Can only access records (claims, leads, etc.) that they have created or have been assigned to.
- **Viewer:** Cannot edit anything in the system. Can only view records they have been associated with.

### Custom Roles

[Section titled “Custom Roles”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/access-rights/#custom-roles)

If the default roles don’t fit your needs, you can create custom roles with specific permissions.

1. Click the **Add** button.
2. Give the new role a **Name** and **Description**.
3. On the **Manage Access Rights** page, you will see a comprehensive list of all possible permissions in the system, grouped by feature area (e.g., Dashboard, Claim, Lead).
4. Use the checkboxes to grant the exact permissions you want this role to have.

This flexibility allows you to create roles tailored to specific job functions, such as a “Field Adjuster” who can only view assigned claims and create activities, or a “Finance Manager” who can only access the accounting sections.

## Claim Automation Settings
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/automation/#_top)

# Automation

The **Automation** section helps you save time by automating repetitive tasks and setting intelligent defaults for new claims.

### Create System Automations

[Section titled “Create System Automations”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/automation/#create-system-automations)

Automations allow you to automatically trigger a set of actions when a claim is created based on its “Reason” (e.g., New Claim, Supplemental, Re-Open).

To create an automation:

1. Click **Add Automation**.
2. Select a **Reason** from the dropdown. This is the trigger for the automation.
3. **Add Staff:** Automatically assign specific staff members to any claim created with this reason.
4. **Add Tasks:** Automatically create and assign one or more tasks. You can set the task title, priority, assignee, and the number of days after claim creation it is due.

This ensures that for every new claim, the right team members are assigned and the initial set of tasks is created without any manual intervention.

### Defaults

[Section titled “Defaults”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/automation/#defaults)

Set system-wide defaults to ensure consistency and speed up data entry.

- **Company Fee:** Set a default company fee percentage or flat rate that will be automatically applied to all new claims. This can be overridden on a per-claim basis if needed.
- **Email:** This email address will be automatically CC’d on any email sent from a claim record via a user’s native email client. This is useful for ensuring a central inbox has a copy of all communications.
- **Default Claim Folders:** Define a standard folder structure that will be automatically created in the **Files** tab for every new claim. This helps keep your documents organized from the very beginning.

## Billing Management
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/billing/#_top)

# Billing & Payment

The **Billing** section is the central hub for managing your subscription and is only accessible to users with the **Owner** role. Here, you can upgrade your plan, adjust the number of user licenses, and monitor your eSignature usage.

### Change Your Plan

[Section titled “Change Your Plan”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/billing/#change-your-plan)

This area displays the available subscription tiers: **Simple**, **Professional**, and **Enterprise**.

- **Upgrade Plan:** You can upgrade to a higher tier at any time to access more advanced features.
- **Adjust User Licenses:** Increase or decrease the number of user licenses on your plan to match your team’s size. The cost per user is displayed for each tier.
- **Downgrade Plan:** To downgrade your plan, you must contact support. This is to ensure you are fully aware of any features or data that may become unavailable on a lower tier.

### Signatures

[Section titled “Signatures”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/billing/#signatures)

Monitor your eSignature usage in this section.

- **eSignatures:** Shows the number of included eSignatures remaining in your current billing cycle and the date they will reset.
- **Paid eSignatures:** If you exceed your included amount, you can purchase additional eSignatures to continue using the feature without interruption.

## Document Templates
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/document-templates/#_top)

# Document Templates

The **Document Templates** section allows you to create and manage reusable templates for documents you frequently generate, such as a Letter of Representation (LOR). By using tokens, you can automatically populate documents with specific claim data, saving time and reducing errors.

### Creating a Template

[Section titled “Creating a Template”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/document-templates/#creating-a-template)

1. **Create a `.docx` file:** First, create your template in a word processor like Microsoft Word and save it as a `.docx` file.
2. **Insert Tokens:** In your document, use tokens as placeholders for claim data. A full list of available tokens can be viewed by clicking the **View Available Fields** button.

   - Example: `Insured(s): [PolicyHolder.FullName]`
3. **Upload the Template:**
   - Click **Create Template**.
   - Give the template a name.
   - Upload your `.docx` file.

### Managing and Previewing Templates

[Section titled “Managing and Previewing Templates”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/document-templates/#managing-and-previewing-templates)

Once uploaded, your templates are listed in the dropdown menu. You can:

- **Preview:** Select a template and then search for a specific claim to see a live preview of how the document will look with that claim’s data merged in.
- **Edit:** Click the pencil icon to rename the template.
- **Delete:** Click the trash can icon to remove the template.

This feature streamlines the creation of consistent, professional, and accurate documentation for every claim.

## External Portal Overview
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/external-portals/#_top)

The **External Portal** is a secure, view-only portal that allows you to share claim progress and key details with external stakeholders, such as the policyholder or an attorney, without giving them full access to the system.

### Manage Portal View

[Section titled “Manage Portal View”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/external-portals/#manage-portal-view)

This admin page gives you complete control over what information is visible in the portal. Using a simple drag-and-drop interface, you can:

- **Select Visible Fields:** Choose exactly which fields from the claim record are displayed to external users.
- **Reorder Fields:** Arrange the fields in a logical order to create a clean and easy-to-understand view for your clients.

### Allow Document Uploads

[Section titled “Allow Document Uploads”](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/external-portals/#allow-document-uploads)

You can empower your clients and other stakeholders to contribute directly to the claim file by enabling document uploads.

- **Allow Documents Uploads:** When this checkbox is enabled, users accessing the portal will see an option to upload files. Any files they upload will be automatically added to the **Files** tab of the corresponding claim record.

This feature is an excellent way to securely and efficiently receive necessary documents from your clients.

## Manage Data Fields
[Skip to content](https://docs.claimmosaic.com/settings/fields/#_top)

# Manage Fields

The **Fields** section provides a powerful drag-and-drop interface to customize the data fields for various record types, including **Claims**, **Leads**, **Contacts**, and **Companies**. This allows you to tailor the application to your specific workflow and data requirements.

- **Due Date Terms:** Set the default payment terms related to the due date (e.g., “Due upon receipt”).
- **Payment Terms:** Add a default block of text that will appear in the “Notes / Terms” section of every invoice. This is the perfect place to include payment instructions, late fee policies, or other standard contractual language.
